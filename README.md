# KNN-Classifier-Machine-Learning-Model-With-Tkinter
# Priority Control and Inspection

I Built a KNN Classifier Machine Learning Model with Tkinter root for a classify a Automotive Parts of IKCO parts
Model includes a KNN Classifier with X features and y target.
Features are:
PPM : Index of defect part that detected in product line of cars
S/R : S : safety part , R : regulary part ( has a Mandatory standard)
Repeat of Alarm : about alarms that sent to suppliers of parts
Not Pokayoke (True word: Pokayoka, is a Japanese word) : about infallibility of parts during production by men
High Price : about high value of cost for part

level for target includes 0 until 5
when part has a 0 level, means that part has a higher importance and needed a inspection with Zero Defect (Search it) and when a part has a 5 level means that part has a lower importance and its not a priority and other levels are determined by their priorities that I considered.

I hope you enjoy
please send me a feedback
